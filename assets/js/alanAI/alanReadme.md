## Follow these steps:

1. Go to [AlanAI](https://alan.app) and signIn
2. Create a project and get the `API_KEY` which can be found on **intergrations** section in [AlanStudio](https://studio.alan.app/projects)
3. Now, in the project you created copy the contents of [`assets/js/alanAI/remoteAlanScript.js`](/assets/js/alanAI/remoteAlanScript.js) to that project.
4. Now change the `API_KEY` in `asstes/js/alanAI/init.js` file (Refer the [Docs](https://alan.app/docs/usage/getting-started) for more Details).
    - Alternatively you can use `5c0e10ba1522cb83798eb8e6af73e2ef2e956eca572e1d8b807a3e2338fdd0dc/stage` as you API_KEY.
5. Add you social media links in `assets/js/alanAI/util.js` in the `openSocial()` funciton and if you want to add more links then you can duplicate the if-else block.
